# Airbnb-Clone
online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their property with people who are looking for accommodations, typically for short stays. Application offers hosts a relatively easy way to earn some income from their property.
This Application helps in matching local people with a spare room or entire home to rent to others who are visiting the area. Hosts using the platform get to advertise their rentals to millions of people worldwide, with the reassurance that a big company will handle payments and offer other support. And for guests, Airbnb can provide a homey place to stay, perhaps with a kitchen to save on dining out, often at a lower price than hotels charge.
